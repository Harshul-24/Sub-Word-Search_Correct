    I am a 3rd year student at IISER Bhopal. I am majoring in Data Science and Engineering.
    I am interested in various subfields of Artficial Intelligence like Deep Learning, Computer Vision,
    Natural Language Processing. I am also interested at the intersection of Biology and Computer Science
    and think that as the human race goes forward in its grand efforts of creating artificial life, it
    cannot afford not to take inspiration from the ongoing laboratory of nature that is millions of years old.

    In my free time I like to watch foreign movies as they serve as gateways to different cultures
     across the world. I am an ardent student of history and you can often find me daydreaming of
     counterfactuals of history and contrast the lives of people across timelines. I am also in awe of
     the spiritual truths embedded in the oldest metaphysical discourse - the Upanishads. This life of
    mine is but an opportunity to realize and enact them. This is especially relevant in the current
    debates on Consciousness, between AI and natural life.
